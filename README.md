# Side Project Marketing

Marketing tactics for promoting your side project.

## Why?

I've been building little software side projects for years, but I've always been terrible at marketing them. I come up with some ideas, forget those ideas, do some random stuff, then lose interest. The goal of this repository is to fix that.

In this repo, I keep a list of the side project marketing tactics and ideas I've picked up from reading sites like [Indie Hackers](https://www.indiehackers.com/), [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/), and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) as well as random books and blog posts. For each of my side projects, I fork this repository and keep a list of what I have done and still need to do. This keeps my marketing efforts more focused, and if anyone else finds it useful, they can make their own fork with their own ideas.
 
## How to use

1. Fork this repository.

2. Add, remove, or modify the tactics lists as you see fit based on your project and customers.

3. Get to work! Each tactic is broken down into handy checklists, so you can keep up with which things you've tried and which you haven't.

4. Profit? I mean, that's the goal, right?

## Organization

Each file in this repository contains a list of marketing tactics within one of the categories below. Some of these categories and items will be relevant to your project, and others may not be.

Each list is meant to be **as comprehensive as possible**. Your job is to **narrow down what works and what doesn't** for your project.

If you have ideas that I _haven't_ included, please see the [Contributing](#contributing) section below.

### Categories

#### [Market Research](market-research.md)
Learning more about your market, competition, and customers helps inform the way you describe your product and the customers you reach out to. This section contains some simple market research tools and tactics you can use to figure out who you're selling to and how to make a product that is better than your competition's.

#### [Cold Outreach](cold-outreach.md)
I hate doing cold outreach because it can feel so spammy, but let's be honest, if you don't tell your future customers you exist, you'll never convince them to give your product a try. One-on-one conversations with customers is often the best way to start making sales and refining your product.

#### [Free Promotional Channels](free.md)
These are sites and places you can promote your product for free...well, except for your time. This section includes lists of business directories and blogs you can pitch your product to among other things. 

#### [Paid Promotional Channels](paid.md)
Here are sites and services that will help you promote your product for a price. Includes lists of online advertisers, commission-based referral networks, and sponsorship programs.

#### [Content Marketing](content.md)
Writing blog posts is time-consuming, especially if you're not a big writer, but there are a lot of ways to use and generate content to help you promote your product. This section includes content marketing tactics.

#### [Other](other.md)
If it doesn't fit into one of the above categories I'm putting it here. As this document improves we may create new categories or rehash existing ones.
