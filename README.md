# Side Project Marketing

## Intro

I've been building little software side projects for years, but I've always been terrible at marketing them. I come up with some ideas, forget those ideas, do some random stuff, then lose interest. The goal of this repository is to fix that.

In this repo, I keep a list of the side project marketing tactics and ideas I've picked up from reading sites like [Indie Hackers](https://www.indiehackers.com/), [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/), and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) as well as random books and blog posts. For each of my side projects, I fork this repository and keep a list of what I have done and still need to do. This keeps my marketing efforts more focused, and if anyone else finds it useful, they can make their own fork with their own ideas.
 
## How to use

1. Fork this repository

2. Modify tactics as you see fit based on your project and customers

3. Get to work! Each tactic is broken down into handy checklists, so you can keep up with which things you've tried and which you have not.

4. Profit? I mean, that's the goal, right?

## Organization

All the marketing tactics and lists are broken down into categories. Check out the [tactics/README.md](tactics/README.md) file for a breakdown of categories.
