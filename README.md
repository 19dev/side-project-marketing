# Side Project Marketing

[A checklist of tactics for marketing your side projects](marketing-checklist.md). 


## Why?

I've been building little software side projects for years, but I've always been terrible at marketing them. I come up with some ideas, forget those ideas, do some random stuff, then lose interest. The goal of this repository is to fix that.

In this repo, I keep a list of the side project marketing tactics and ideas I've picked up from reading sites like [Indie Hackers](https://www.indiehackers.com/), [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/), and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) as well as random books and blog posts. For each of my side projects, I fork this repository and keep a list of what I have done and still need to do. This keeps my marketing efforts more focused, and if anyone else finds it useful, they can make their own fork with their own ideas.


## How to use

1. Copy the [marketing-checklist.md](marketing-checklist.md) file or [fork this repository](https://github.com/karllhughes/side-project-marketing).

2. Add, remove, or modify the tactics as you see fit based on your project and customers.

3. Get to work! The checklist format allows you to keep up with which things you've tried and which you haven't.

4. Profit? I mean, that's the goal, right?


## Organization

This list is meant to be **as comprehensive as possible**. Your job is to **narrow down what works and what doesn't** for your project. This list also does not attempt to teach you *how* to do most of these things - that's something you'll have to research on your own - but the list stays focused on simple descriptions of tasks you can do to market your side project or startup.

Finally, **the list is ordered in chronological order**. Things you will do before your product launch are typically at the top of the list and things you will do later show up at the bottom.

If you have ideas that I _haven't_ included or you think you could improve the list, please see the [Contributing](#contributing) section below. I'm not a marketing professional so I welcome any and all feedback!
