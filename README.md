# Side Project Marketing

A list of side project marketing tactics for software products and services.

## Why?

I've been building little software side projects for years, but I've always been terrible at marketing them. I come up with some ideas, forget those ideas, do some random stuff, then lose interest. The goal of this repository is to fix that.

In this repo, I keep a list of the side project marketing tactics and ideas I've picked up from reading sites like [Indie Hackers](https://www.indiehackers.com/), [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/), and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) as well as random books and blog posts. For each of my side projects, I fork this repository and keep a list of what I have done and still need to do. This keeps my marketing efforts more focused, and if anyone else finds it useful, they can make their own fork with their own ideas.
 
## How to use

1. Fork this repository.

2. Add, remove, or modify the tactics lists as you see fit based on your project and customers.

3. Get to work! Each tactic is broken down into handy checklists, so you can keep up with which things you've tried and which you haven't.

4. Profit? I mean, that's the goal, right?

## Organization

The [tactics/](tactics) directory contains a list of marketing tactics broken down by category. Some of these categories will be relevant to your project, and others may not be.

Each list is meant to be **as comprehensive as possible**. Your job is to **narrow down what works and what doesn't** for your project.

If you have ideas that I _haven't_ included, please submit a [issue](https://github.com/karllhughes/side-project-marketing/issues) or [pull request](https://github.com/karllhughes/side-project-marketing/pulls). We can all benefit from the shared knowledge.

### Categories

#### [Market Research](tactics/market-research.md)
Learning more about your market, competition, and customers is an often-overlooked part of marketing, but it helps inform the way you describe your product and the customers you reach out to. This section contains some simple market research tools and tactics you can use to get a grip on who you're selling to and why your product or service is better than your competition.

#### [Cold Outreach](tactics/cold-outreach.md)
I hate doing cold outreach because it can feel so spammy, but let's be honest, if you don't tell your future customers you exist, you'll never convince them to give your product or service a try.

#### [Free Promotional Channels](tactics/free.md)
These are sites and places you can promote your product for free...well, except for your time.

#### [Paid Promotional Channels](tactics/paid.md)
Sites and services that will help you promote your product for a price.

#### [Content Marketing](tactics/content.md)
Writing blog posts is _extremely_ time-consuming, especially if you're not a big writer, but there are a lot of ways to use and generate content to help you promote your product. 

#### [Other](tactics/other.md)
If it doesn't fit into one of the above categories I'm putting it here.
