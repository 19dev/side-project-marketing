# Side Project Marketing

A checklist of tactics for marketing your side projects. 


## Why?

I've been building little software side projects for years, but I've always been terrible at marketing them. I come up with some ideas, forget those ideas, do some random stuff, then lose interest. The goal of this repository is to fix that.

In this repo, I keep a list of the side project marketing tactics and ideas I've picked up from reading sites like [Indie Hackers](https://www.indiehackers.com/), [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/), and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) as well as random books and blog posts. For each of my side projects, I fork this repository and keep a list of what I have done and still need to do. This keeps my marketing efforts more focused, and if anyone else finds it useful, they can make their own fork with their own ideas.

## How to use

1. Fork this repository.

2. Add, remove, or modify the tactics as you see fit based on your project and customers.

3. Get to work! The checklist format allows you to keep up with which things you've tried and which you haven't.

4. Profit? I mean, that's the goal, right?


## Organization

This list is meant to be **as comprehensive as possible**. Your job is to **narrow down what works and what doesn't** for your project. This list also does not attempt to teach you *how* to do most of these things - that's something you'll have to research on your own - but the list stays focused on simple descriptions of tasks you can do to market your side project or startup.

If you have ideas that I _haven't_ included or you think you could improve the list, please see the [Contributing](#contributing) section below. I'm not a marketing professional so I welcome any and all feedback.

### Market Research

> _If we knew what were doing it wouldn’t be called research._ - Albert Einstein

Learning more about your market, competition, and customers helps inform the way you describe your product and the customers you reach out to. This section contains some simple market research tools and tactics you can use to figure out who you're selling to and how to make a product that is better than your competition's.

- [ ] Make a list of competitive/alternative services.

  ##### Finding competitors
  - [ ] [Alexa](http://www.alexa.com/find-similar-sites)
  - [ ] [AlternativeTo](https://alternativeto.net)
  - [ ] [AngelList](https://angel.co/)
  - [ ] [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/)
  - [ ] [SimilarSites](http://www.similarsites.com/)

- [ ] Make a list of the "one-liners" and taglines competitors use.
- [ ] Take note of the pricing model(s) competitors use.
- [ ] Subscribe to RSS feeds of your competitors' blogs.
- [ ] Follow your competitors and their top employees on social media.
- [ ] Set up [Google News alerts](https://www.google.com/alerts) for competitors.
- [ ] Subscribe to industry newsletters, magazines, trade journals etc.
- [ ] Attend a conference or meetup in your industry.
- [ ] Make a list of your competitors' customers.

  ##### Finding competitors' customers
  - [ ] Check their Twitter followers, mentions
  - [ ] Look through their Facebook fans
  - [ ] People who follow them on Linkedin
  - [ ] Some companies list customer stories on their websites

- [ ] Set up website/app analytics to learn about who signs up, bounces, etc.
- [ ] Run a customer poll (can also generate content for your blog or social media channels).

### Cold Outreach

> _You should be talking to a small number of users who are seriously interested in what you’re making, not a broad audience who are on the whole indifferent._ - Jessica Livingston, Founding Partner at Y Combinator

I hate doing cold outreach because it can feel so spammy, but let's be honest, if you don't tell your future customers you exist, you'll never convince them to give your product a try. One-on-one conversations with customers is often the best way to start making sales and refining your product.

- [ ] Find people in your contact list who might be future customers. Take them out to lunch to get their feedback.
- [ ] Send a coupon code to close friends and family members to let them try your product.
- [ ] Reach out to your social media followers, ask them to try your product.
- [ ] Reach out to social media followers of your competitors, find out what they do well, why they're customers, ask them to try your service.
- [ ] Cold call ~20 people who might be good customers.
- [ ] Attend meetups or conferences for your target market.
- [ ] Add potential customers on Linkedin, reach out when they accept.
- [ ] Give free access to influential bloggers in the industry.
- [ ] Meet another entrepreneur who has a similar but noncompetitive product.
- [ ] Watch a first time user use your product.
- [ ] Run an early-stage cold email campaign.

  ##### An early-stage cold email campaign
  - [ ] Make a list of 30 prospective early customers' email addresses.
  - [ ] Send three cold emails per day for ten days. Experiment with messaging, take note of what works.
  - [ ] Send three follow up emails per day for ten days. Experiment with messaging, take note of what works.
  - [ ] Scale it up! Find more prospects, set up an automated drip campaign, rinse and repeat every month.

- [ ] Ask your customers for feedback directly (individual outreach).

### Free Promotional Channels

> _I don't care how much money you have, free stuff is always a good thing._ - Queen Latifah
