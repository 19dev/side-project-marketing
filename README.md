# Side Project Marketing

Marketing tactics for promoting your side project.


## Why?

I've been building little software side projects for years, but I've always been terrible at marketing them. I come up with some ideas, forget those ideas, do some random stuff, then lose interest. The goal of this repository is to fix that.

In this repo, I keep a list of the side project marketing tactics and ideas I've picked up from reading sites like [Indie Hackers](https://www.indiehackers.com/), [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/), and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) as well as random books and blog posts. For each of my side projects, I fork this repository and keep a list of what I have done and still need to do. This keeps my marketing efforts more focused, and if anyone else finds it useful, they can make their own fork with their own ideas.


## How to use

1. Fork this repository.

2. Add, remove, or modify the tactics lists as you see fit based on your project and customers.

3. Get to work! Each tactic is broken down into handy checklists, so you can keep up with which things you've tried and which you haven't.

4. Profit? I mean, that's the goal, right?


## Organization

Each file in this repository contains a list of marketing tactics within one of the categories below. Some of these categories and items will be relevant to your project, and others may not be.

Each list is meant to be **as comprehensive as possible**. Your job is to **narrow down what works and what doesn't** for your project.

If you have ideas that I _haven't_ included, please see the [Contributing](#contributing) section below.

### Market Research
Learning more about your market, competition, and customers helps inform the way you describe your product and the customers you reach out to. This section contains some simple market research tools and tactics you can use to figure out who you're selling to and how to make a product that is better than your competition's.

> _If we knew what were doing it wouldn’t be called research._ - Albert Einstein

#### Tactics

- [ ] Make a list of competitive/alternative services.

  ##### Finding competitors
  - [ ] [Alexa](http://www.alexa.com/find-similar-sites)
  - [ ] [AlternativeTo](https://alternativeto.net)
  - [ ] [AngelList](https://angel.co/)
  - [ ] [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/)
  - [ ] [SimilarSites](http://www.similarsites.com/)

- [ ] Make a list of the "one-liners" and taglines competitors use.
- [ ] Take note of the pricing model(s) competitors use.

  - [ ] Some companies list customer stories on their websites

- [ ] Set up website/app analytics to learn about who signs up, bounces, etc.

### Cold Outreach
I hate doing cold outreach because it can feel so spammy, but let's be honest, if you don't tell your future customers you exist, you'll never convince them to give your product a try. One-on-one conversations with customers is often the best way to start making sales and refining your product.

> _You should be talking to a small number of users who are seriously interested in what you’re making, not a broad audience who are on the whole indifferent._ - Jessica Livingston, Founding Partner at Y Combinator

#### Tactics

- [ ] Find people in your contact list who might be future customers. Take them out to lunch to get their feedback.
- [ ] Send a coupon code to close friends and family members to let them try your product.
- [ ] Reach out to your social media followers, ask them to try your product.
- [ ] Reach out to social media followers of your competitors, find out what they do well, why they're customers, ask them to try your service.

- [ ] Attend meetups or conferences for your target market.
- [ ] Add potential customers on Linkedin, reach out when they accept.
- [ ] Give free access to influential bloggers in the industry.
- [ ] Run an early-stage cold email campaign.

  ##### An early-stage cold email campaign
  - [ ] Make a list of 30 prospective early customers' email addresses.
  - [ ] Send three cold emails per day for ten days. Experiment with messaging, take note of what works.
  - [ ] Send three follow up emails per day for ten days. Experiment with messaging, take note of what works.
  - [ ] Scale it up! Find more prospects, set up an automated drip campaign, rinse and repeat every month.
