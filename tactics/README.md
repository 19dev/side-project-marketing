# Side Project Marketing Tactics

This directory contains a list of marketing tactics broken down by category. Some of these categories will be relevant to your project, and others may not be. Each list of tactics within each category will have items which are relevant and others which are not.

Each list is meant to be **as comprehensive as possible**. Your job is to narrow down what works and what doesn't work for you.

## Categories

### [Market Research](market-research.md)
Learning more about your market, competition, and customers is an often-overlooked part of marketing, but it helps inform the way you describe your product and the customers you reach out to. This section contains some simple market research tools and tactics you can use to get a grip on who you're selling to and why your product or service is better than your competition.

### [Cold Outreach](cold-outreach.md)
I hate doing cold outreach because it can feel so spammy, but let's be honest, if you don't tell your future customers you exist, you'll never convince them to give your product or service a try.

### [Free Promotional Channels](free.md)
These are sites and places you can promote your product for free...well, except for your time.

### [Paid Promotional Channels](paid.md)
Sites and services that will help you promote your product for a price.

### [Content Marketing](content.md)
Writing blog posts is _extremely_ time-consuming, especially if you're not a big writer, but there are a lot of ways to use and generate content to help you promote your product. 

### [Other](other.md)
If it doesn't fit into one of the above categories I'm putting it here.
